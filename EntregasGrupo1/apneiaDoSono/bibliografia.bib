abstract = {The usage of wearable devices has gained popularity in the latest years, especially for health-care and well being. Recently there has been an increasing interest in using these devices to improve the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The quality of data acquired through wearable sensors is generally lower than what medical-grade devices provide, and existing datasets have mainly been acquired in highly controlled clinical conditions. In the context of the D1NAMO project — aiming to detect glycemic events through non-invasive ECG pattern analysis — we elaborated a dataset that can be used to help developing health-care systems based on wearable devices in non-clinical conditions. This paper describes this dataset, which was acquired on 20 healthy subjects and 9 patients with type-1 diabetes. The acquisition has been made in real-life conditions with the Zephyr BioHarness 3 wearable device. The dataset consists of ECG, breathing, and accelerometer signals, as well as glucose measurements and annotated food pictures. We open this dataset to the scientific community in order to allow the development and evaluation of diabetes management algorithms.}

    abstract = { Background:Monitoring glucose excursions is important in diabetes management. This can be achieved using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, CGMs are expensive and invasive. Thus, alternative low-cost noninvasive wearable sensors capable of predicting glycemic excursions could be a game changer to manage diabetes.Methods:In this article, we explore two noninvasive sensor modalities, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and accelerometers, collected on five healthy participants over two weeks, to predict both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions. We extract 29 features encompassing heart rate variability features from the ECG, and time- and frequency-domain features from the accelerometer. We evaluated two machine-learning approaches to predict glycemic excursions: a classification model and a regression model.Results:The best model for both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia detection was the regression model based on ECG and accelerometer data, yielding 76\% sensitivity and specificity for hypoglycemia and 79\% sensitivity and specificity for hyperglycemia. This had an improvement of 5\% in sensitivity and specificity for both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia when compared with using ECG data alone.Conclusions:Electrocardiogram is a promising alternative not only to detect hypoglycemia but also to predict hyperglycemia. Supplementing ECG data with contextual information from accelerometer data can improve glucose prediction. }

   abstract = {Tracking the fluctuations in blood glucose levels is important for healthy subjects and crucial diabetic patients. Tight glucose monitoring reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, which can result in a series of complications, especially in diabetic patients, such as confusion, irritability, seizure and can even be fatal in specific conditions. Hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the heart. However, due to strong inter-subject heterogeneity, previous studies based on a cohort of subjects failed to deploy electrocardiogram (ECG)-based hypoglycemic detection systems reliably. The current study used personalised medicine approach and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically detect nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw ECG signal recorded with non-invasive, wearable devices, in healthy individuals, monitored 24 hours for 14 consecutive days. Additionally, we present a visualisation method enabling clinicians to visualise which part of the ECG signal (e.g., T-wave, ST-interval) is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject, overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods. These results advance the feasibility of a real-time, non-invasive hypoglycemia alarming system using short excerpts of ECG signal.},
