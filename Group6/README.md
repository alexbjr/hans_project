# Summary Description of the Project

Machine learning techniques, today, have their success linearly related to the quantity and quality of data that are used to train the models. However, in some scenarios, accessing data may be more difficult, e.g. medical data. This happens because data classification depends on a manual task by experts in the field, and also because there is a concern about the privacy of the collected data. Therefore, in this project, we seek to investigate possible data augmentation techniques for medical data, so that we can, in the end, understand the influence of these techniques in an image classification context.

By comparing the results of the model trained with different augmentation techniques, we  will demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in improving the model's accuracy. The final outcome is a robust image classification model that can efficiently differentiate between the images, contributing to faster and more accurate medical image classification and also determine the risks related to the use of data augmentation on the images.

# Methodology


We aim to explore Deep learning models for image classification (e.g. CNNs) to evaluate and compare the effects of each data augmentation technique. The techniques will be some of that highlighted in Garcea et. al (2023), an article that presents a systematic literature review on the topic.


# Tools

Python, Google Collab, Deep Learning Libraries ( Scikit-learn, Tensorflow) , Data visualization libraries ( Matplotlib, seaborn, plotly ) and whatever tools needed to complete the project.
